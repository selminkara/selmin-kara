Hey Selmin! 

I'm gonna be leaving you notes on where and how to make your edits in these brackets. 

To start editing, click on the PENCIL ICON in the top right of this box. 
Once you're ready to save, just click on the green COMMIT CHANGES button at the bottom of the page (you can skip filling in the description boxes).

If you find it difficult to scroll horizontally for all the long lines of text, click on the box in the top right that says NO WRAP and change it to SOFT WRAP.
This is just for your viewing and won't change how your website looks!

To find a section you want to edit/add to, press CMD + F and type "#[section]" (i.e. #research) and hit ENTER. 
First, the section's sidebar link will be highlighted, then pressing CMD + F then ENTER the second time will lead you to the section's content.


TEXT:

	For any copy edits you want to make, you'll only need to change whatever text is in between tags <p>like this</p>.

	If you want to add another item to a list, copy and paste the entire line WITH the tags <li>like this</li>.
	Make sure you don't copy any extra tags — every item should have MATCHING opening tag(s) (<li>, <h3>, <p>) and closing tag(s) (</li>, </h3>, </p>).


IMAGES:

	To add NEW images directly from YOUR COMPUTER, first upload them to the "img" folder (right click on "selmin-kara" and open it in a new tab, 
	click on the blue "img" folder, then click on ADD FILE on the right side of the page and select UPLOAD FILES, drag your file into the box, then
	finally scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the green COMMIT CHANGES button)
	Then, copy and paste this line of code:
		<img src="img/[FILE_NAME]">
	...and paste the name of the file with the exact capitalization and extension (i.e. Events_Poster1.jpg) and avoid spaces in the name.

	To add NEW images directly from ONLINE, copy and paste this line of code:
		<img src="[URL_NAME]">
	...and paste the url exactly as is (with the https://) and ensure the link you use ENDS WITH THE FILE EXTENSION (.jpg .png .gif)

	To make the image smaller, use this line of code for UPLOADED IMAGES:
		<img class="smaller" src="img/[FILE_NAME]">
	...and this line of code for IMAGES FROM ONLINE:
		<img class="smaller" src="[URL_NAME]">


Anything without a comment from me you can disregard :)

						A playformance piece that is part of Maziar Ghaderi’s Masters in Design research, Playformance. “Dissolving Self” employs metaphoric data visualization, motion capture and wearable technology to harness the subtle movements of a contemporary dancer. A gyroscope and a radio module (Xbee) worn by the dancer measure and transmit speed of rotation and a Microsoft Kinect captures lateral movement. These two sets of live data are fed into Processing, an open source software to create a responsive and metaphoric visualization that is projected over the dancer.

						<a href="https://vimeo.com/92749306" target="_blank">“Jadoo Banoo: Leap Motion X Poetry”</a>
						A customized networked-performance that is part of Maziar Ghaderi’s Masters in Design research, Playformance. Ghaderi animated and projected the words of Jadoo Banoo’s poem on and across the stage. The disorderly path of the words was formed by the hand gestures captured over the Leap Motion and the font size was determined by the speed of the gestures. Jadoo Banoo uses the performer’s spontaneous movements as embodied acts of articulation to translate spoken poetry and explores how the performer spatially interacts with and within the virtual representation of her own poetic text.

					</li>


					<!--This is the description for the "ProprioMedia Colloquium Series" event-->
					<li>
						“ProprioMedia Colloquium Series”, which ran between 2013–2016, was a speaker series organized by Selmin Kara and David McIntosh at OCAD University. Its goal was to establish a dialogue among scholars working in various fields related to or intersecting with media studies and research at OCAD University and select institutions in North America. The colloquia took place monthly and featured 2–3 speakers, delivering 25–30 minute presentations, followed by a Q&A. <br> Meaning behind the title: “ProprioMedia” is a coined concept invoking the associations of the Latin term proprius—meaning “one’s own,” “proper,” or “individual,”—in the larger context of media theory and practice. Proprioception as a bodily basis for spatial and multi-sensory consciousness has been a source of rising interest in new media and film-related research in recent years but one can also think about the significance of proprietary thinking for understanding how various media practices relate to the self as well as the collective through the individual. It also refers to the “characteristic,” that is to say, the particular and the distinguishing, underscoring the series’ openness to innovative research that encompasses a wide range of topics.
